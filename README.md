## Basic Details

### Team Name: Swathi H Nair

### Team Members
- Member 1: Swathi H Nair - TocH Institution of Science and Technology
  

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
Google Drive and Gmail APIs are used by Auto Kuttan, an AI-powered assistant, to automate tasks.
Through a clever chat-based interface, users can send emails, download files, and process data with ease.

### The Problem statement
It takes a lot of time and repetition to handle chores like sending emails, downloading files from Google Drive, and manually processing data.
Users frequently switch between platforms, which lowers productivity and raises the possibility of mistakes.
A centralized, intelligent system that can effectively automate these tasks is required.

### The Solution
Using a straightforward chat-based interface, Auto Kuttan is an AI-powered automation assistant that works with Google Drive and Gmail to complete tasks.
From a single dashboard, users can easily process CSV data, send emails, and download files.
The system increases user productivity, efficiency, and saves time by automating repetitive workflows.
